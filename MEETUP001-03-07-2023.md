# READING GROUP #1 

https://www.meetup.com/san-francisco-cognitive-science-meetup-group/events/291413888/

# Details
This will be our first meeting, for us to gather and discuss a reading (likely a book)

## UPDATE: we had a few submissions for books but no patterns to them, so I am nominating "Being You" by Anil Seth for our first reading:

The venue details are in the event description. There is on-street parking nearby, somewhere to chain bicycles directly outside.
