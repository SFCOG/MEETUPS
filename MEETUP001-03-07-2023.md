https://www.meetup.com/san-francisco-cognitive-science-meetup-group/events/291413888/

# Details
This will be our first meeting, for us to gather and discuss a reading (likely a book)

## UPDATE: we had a few submissions for books but no patterns to them, so I am nominating "Being You" by Anil Seth for our first reading:

review: It was an interesting evening; everyone else - sorry we missed you.

[TOM] I’ve written up some notes from our conversation. They’re scrappy but may be useful. I’ll also send around a form to gather feedback and reading suggestions for our next event, which we’ll put in the calendar soon.
